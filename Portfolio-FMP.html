                <h3>A systematic deployment to support personal fruit-intake behaviors in the home-based cardiac rehabilitation context.</h3>


                <p>The e-health project was developed in collaboration with Maxima Medisch Centrum in the Netherlands.<span style=" color:#73C08C"> The challenge was to perform a digital conversation to transform from traditional physical cardiac rehabilitation to a form of systematic digital solutions in the home context, making it more accessible for the patient to follow their target goals at home, and meanwhile reducing the healthcare providers' workload.</span> Eventually, I designed and developed an IoT system solution that aims to <span style=" color:#73C08C">motivate the patient/user to follow the desired goals through suitable interaction. The form of design is a form of a systematic approach to presenting user data in different scenarios both on digital and tangible UI. </span> The evaluation criteria focusing from the patient-centered perspective in terms of User Experiences concern the design solution's usefulness, accessibility, and the potential of users' sustained desired behaviors.  </p>

				<p>This entire project mainly went through 4 full iterative cycles. In the exploring phase, I discovered the context and researched the (potential)issues of the current medical experts, and inquested target group's context through participatory user research approaches. That gave rich qualitative stakeholder insights, about what user data is needed and what forms of user interaction in the contextual experiences are preferred. Following that, based on the user inputs I decided to co-create with the medical stakeholders for the feasible solutions.</p>
				<p>In the product development phase for 2+ iterations, to ensure the best user experience I experimented several rounds of technical testing with hardware and software developers to figure out feasible technical solutions for implementing the fully-functional prototype in the context. In the later stage, to validate the effectiveness and user experience I tested with target groups with 8+ participants and anaylized the user data and product performance through in-depth qualitative and quantitative data based on acceptance criteria.</p>

				<h2><strong>How do the medical stakeholders perceive the existing platform in tracking patients’ (diet) goals?</strong></h2>
				<h5>Discovering the problems of the industry client's existing platform</h5>
				<p>It was very important for me to understand how healthcare providers perceived an existing platform for tracking patient diet goals. To get started, I conducted a card-sorting session to map out the assumptions. Through this process, I discovered that the medical stakeholders thought that the ease of use, particularly for the senior patient group was the most critical thing. We wanted to ensure that the platform was not only functional but also intuitive enough to trigger sustainable behaviors among senior adults.</p>

				  <h2><strong>How does the user perceive the self-tracking methods on dietary behaviors in terms of easy-to-use and sustainable behaviors?</strong></h2>
			    <h5>Participatory design methods to engage target user groups</h5>
				 <p>I embarked on a design process for a health project that required behavior change. I knew that understanding the user's context was crucial, especially for the senior user groups, so I decided to prototype engaging user experiences and evaluate perceived values through diary study methods with user groups.</p>
				  <p>Through this process, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of what users expected and how we could make it more accessible for them to track their dietary behaviors. By tracking behavior change criteria and collecting feedback, I organized two main personas, one for those living alone and another for those living with partners.</p>	
				<p>These personas served as a guide for our design decisions, ensuring that we were addressing the unique needs of each user group. Through this approach, we were able to create solutions that not only met the functional requirements but also resonated with users and motivated behavior change.</p>

				<h2><strong>How might we use an engaging behavior-tracking approach to help the senior patient groups to achieve their goals in a more sustainable way?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>	
				<h5>Streamling the common values based on the feedback</h5>
					
				<p>I wanted to streamline feedback from medical stakeholders and users. To achieve this, I created some "<strong><span style="color:#73C08C">How Might We</span></strong>" statements, with the main one focusing on using an engaging behavior-tracking approach to help senior patients achieve their goals in a more sustainable way.</p>
				
				<p>Through co-reflecting sessions with stakeholders, we discussed user journeys, experiences, personas, and scenarios while ideating solutions and generating design assumptions. To ensure we were prioritizing the design assumptions that had a higher perceived value to end-users and a meaningful impact on stakeholders, we conducted a prioritization exercise.</p>
				
				<p>After prioritizing the design assumptions, we formulated a hypothesis: <strong><span style="color:#73C08C">"I believe that the combination of a tangible and digital user interface can engage senior patient groups' dietary behaviors as a daily routine, reducing their efforts in self-tracking and leading to sustainable impact."</span></strong></p>

			<h5>Define design scope and value propositions</h5>
				<p>In order to reach more sustainable prospects for design solutions, I researched the ecosystem regarding the connection, revenue channels, and parties in the relationship to better define the value propositions. </p>
				<p>Central by the patient/user-centered perspectives in the context of (remote) home, I explained how in the entire user flow the design solutions can provide its values to the patient/user from the direct interaction to different (indrect) scenarios, with the user data can be collected and translated to suggestions and feedback to the stakeholders.&nbsp;So that I elaborated the value propositions for all the stakeholders in the scope. </p>
				<p>In regard to this, I started building rapid (tangible prototype), information presented on digital UI, and implemented to the target participants' home. I used paper mockup to mimic the user's health data in its visualization for requesting user's feedback. </p>

We first focused on a tangible device that provides a consistent UX for end-users and efficient data collection for healthcare providers. I worked with the development team to prioritize tasks based on importance and estimated effort, focusing on user engagement and behavior tracking. We developed smooth user-system interactions and presented the realized features to the client. </p>
				<p>For the final sprint, we designed a behavior-tracking feature to provide timely patient data to healthcare providers. After bringing the product to senior user groups' homes to assess contextual scenarios, I found that generally, the senior user groups were happy with the tangible interaction. For long-term sustainable impact, however, customized features could be added to the tangible device and longer testing could be required for higher design credibility.

				<h2><strong>How might we integrate the tangible device into the existing rehabilitation flow to help senior patients lower the threshold of entering telerehabilitation?</strong></h2>  
				<h5>Evaluation on UX system in telerehabilitation context</h5>
 				<p>After finalizing the features of the tangible device, I discussed with the business industry client the potential to integrate it into their existing rehabilitation flow for senior patients. Using user journey and process mapping, I identified touchpoints between patients and healthcare providers. I generated design assumptions to test in usability testing, exploring senior adults' tolerance for being guided through the digital journey, planned behavior making, feedback receiving, and making sense of the tangible and digital UI. </p>

			<h5>Usability testing on the criteria</h5>
			<p>5 participants who were also engaged in the previous home-deployment iteration were invited to continue evaluating on their experiences using digital UI. The goal of the study was to evaluate how users would recognize the connection between user data visualization, and the digital guidance through the telerehabbilitation journey concerning the accessibility, usefulness, and informativeness on the provided challenges. There were 5 challenges as shown in below. The criteria used are feasibility, accessibility, the effectiveness of the system design, and user satisfaction.</p>

				<h2>Learning & Takeaway</h2>
				<p>This Master Thesis Project was built upon <span style=" color:#34B8AF">the current architecture of the telerehabilitation system structured by Maxima MC, integrating the touchpoints with the healthcare providers from a patient-centered perspective.</span> The final results of the project were presented to the client and stakeholders for the potential of real-world executions. This project allowed me to acquire valuable learnings:</p>

				<h5>Project management skills to work with involved stakeholders. </h5>
				<p>Because the project involved many stakeholders (clients, domain experts, and users), I learned the importance of <span style=" color:#34B8AF">advance planning and efficient communication with different parties for scheduling sessions and time management skills.</span> In this project, I created a roadmap to file all the decision-making points and the time spent.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h5>Design communication is important when presenting the design concept to stakeholders.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </h5>
				<p>Furthermore, to be more flexible during the iterative process of working with stakeholders, <span style=" color:#34B8AF">making planning and sharing (discussion) results properly is critical in communication and project management. Preparing alternatives (plan B) to adapt/pivot to different situations.</span> Whereas, it is always important for a designer you could advocate why the design decision is better than other choices.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				  			  

				<h5>MVPs are the balance of the user's needs and technical constraints within the limited timeframe. </h5>
				<p>I spent weeks with developers in the organization to experiment/test the stability and the effectiveness of the prototype, from which I learned the importance of <span style=" color:#34B8AF">identified efficient MVPs to process the iterative development is built open prioritizing user requirements and balancing out the design increments with various technical constraints</span> within a limited time frame.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			  </div>
              <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">

				<h5>Creative Design thinking methods require user/stakeholders' engagement during the iterative process. </h5>
				<p>The methods of <span style=" color:#34B8AF">workshops and post-co-reflecting sessions to criticize the design from different perspectives</span> can bring the design concept to a more grounded and realistic level for execution not only building the confidence of the teammates but the stakeholders</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h5>Challenge when designing for the systematic approach (combined with tangible and digital UI) in complex scenarios: </h5>
				<p>The combined tangible and digital approach were proven effective and had strong potential for the target patient groups, where different levels of interaction were involved to motivate the user groups to follow the target diet goals. However, despite the entire telerehabilitation structure within the design concept being discussed with different domain experts, one of the challenges that should be further evaluated with user groups is <span style=" color:#34B8AF">the longer-term scenario when several telerehabilitation domains are simultaneously executed so that the way to interact and the information to be presented can be investigated and prioritized to avoid the overwhelming information. 
				As a service, prioritizing the functionalities with more impact or less effort on the experience could add value on a personalized level.</span></p>
