                  <h1>Teletician</h1>
                <h3>A tangible deployment to support personal fruit-intake habits in the home-based cardiac rehabilitation context.</h3>


                <p>Teletician is a product-service system that assists patients/users undergoing Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) in performing targeted dietary behaviors in a healthier and more consistent manner. Home-based CR programs typically combine on-site and online sessions, with a focus on patients’ health information tracking in their daily lives. When it comes to dietary habits, one of the most important points for the patient group (user) to notice and follow is a healthy and regular way of eating fruit. This could serve as a prioritized diet goal at some extent. However, it could be challenging for these patients to always keep a healthy fruit intake in mind or to follow a regular intake pattern at home.</p>
                <p> Therefore, the project aims to facilitate patients’ healthy fruit-intake behaviors, with a focus on their home environment, by deploying an interactive connected device that persuades patients to behave in the desired manner while also make monitoring the patients’ fruit-intake behaviors by collecting relevant data. A series of qualitative user studies were carried out. The design research process went through several iterations, guided by insights and findings gleaned from two phases of user testing and discussion with an expert. </p>
                <p>The final design of Teletician for patients includes product design, user experience design, and service design. Focusing on the patient’s home environment, the tangible design facilitates a meaningful and thoughtful interaction by communicating the patient’s daily fruit-intake conditions. The generated interactive light increased the user’s awareness while also provoking his/her thoughts about personal health intake by reflecting on one’s behaviors, and allowing the user to further explore the desired lifestyle. </p>
                <p>The design also allowed relevant healthcare providers, particularly specialized dieticians, to track the patient by analyzing data collected from the connected device. Furthermore, a message is automatically generated and sent to the user on a connected personal application for evaluating more contextual situations about the exact intake. An application can also provide access to more detailed relevant information, such as feedback and suggestions, as well as other domains required in cardiac rehabilitation. </p>
                <p>Focusing on the people of higher ages and having the motivation to change their relevant behaviors, the design research aims to collect qualitative insights from the field study. The user evaluation of the design validates that the thoughtful interaction with the interactive light and the setting of the tangible product, and the experiences together, can indeed enhance user awareness and reflection on their specific health intake and pose a positive impact on the user during the iterative design research process. </p>

			  <h2><strong>First Prototype: In-Field Diary Exploration&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</h2>
		
			    <p>From the user’s perspective, the developed prototype uses a systematic interaction design approach that focuses on tangible interaction between the artifact and the user. A system approach investigates the interactions between people, activities, objects, technologies, and the environment. An artifact can then engage and motivate the user (a person who wants to increase their fruit intake) to participate in an activity to achieve a goal. Accordingly, I created an interactive prototype for communicating personal fruit intake information in the home context. This also functions as a tracking system for the user to know their fruit intake condition, and more precise data about fruit intake can thus be collected by detecting weight change. </p>
			    <p>The goal of this study is to look into qualitative insights into the user’s contextual experience in a specific context. These preliminary perception and interpretation insights were gathered and used to develop the higher fidelity prototype. The interactive prototype was deployed in the participant’s home for three continuous days. A total of 3 participants (2 male and 1 female) took part in the diary study. The setup of the interactive prototype was in the kitchen/dining room location. All notifications and the lighting features are preprogrammed and the interactive mechanism is made to automatically work.&nbsp;</p>

				<h2><strong>High-fidelity Prototype:&nbsp; In-the-wild Diary Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</h2>
				  
				<p>Following the findings and insights from the second iteration, a series of different tests were conducted for the final prototype and its field implementation of the project. A thorough schema about how I have prototyped and decided can be accessed in the report, in which I analyzed the findings, detailing the elements and then synthesizing the investigated possibilities. After numerous technical experiments, the prototype and the implementation setting were determined. </p>

				<p> The setup of the interactive prototype was in the kitchen/dining room location. A manual booklet was placed next to the prototype where participants were asked to document their actions and experience in taking fruit.
				  The interaction of the prototype remains similar to the previous iteration. While the programmed light effects were modified for more human-like characteristics. When the fruit bowl is full and the user is moving in the neighborhood, yellow breathing effects are presented as background to inform not any fruit has been taken. Greenlight effects appear briefly to encourage the user’s action of eating fruit. When there is still some fruit left in the bowl the orange breathing effect appears in the background. Blue light effects blink dynamically to celebrate the user’s daily fruit-intake goal achievement. When the user refills fruit for the new day, a green light wiping effect will be prompted to encourage the user’s action. </p>

				<h2><strong>Results analysis </strong>&nbsp;</h2>  
				  
				<p>Using the thematic analysis method the clustering of the data revealed several themes about the way participants made sense of their experiences (find in report). In particular, by means of technology-based experience approach certain psychological needs (competence and autonomy) were evaluated from which adapted according to Peters et al.’s work with a 5-Likert scale. Eventually, the use of a comparison box-plots diagram depicts the change in participants’ confidence in fruit-intake behavior before and after the study using a 5-Likert scale.</p>

				<h2><strong>Service Design &amp; Patient/User Journey </strong>&nbsp;</h2>  
 				<p>A service blueprint is therefore built to visualize the patient/ user journey with the interactions among stakeholders and services relevant to the design. The patient is introduced to cardiac rehabilitation (CR), where he or she learns about the importance of maintaining personal health. Especially following a healthy eating pattern is emphasized. Therefore, specific diet goals are identified for the patient to follow during the CR program. Having regular fruit intake, for example, is one of the prioritized goals for the patient. The patient is introduced to the system at the start of the CR program. For first-time use, there will be a greeting message sent from an app to guide the user through the first set according to the patient’s identified goal, and then mapping the device. For everyday use, a series of looping behaviors is provided by an interactive fruit bowl to support the patient’s desired lifestyle, at the same time, collecting the patient’s performed behaviors. A connected application is used to evaluate the patient’s contextual situation, visualize the user’s performance in relation to the target goal, and even provide feedback and suggestions. When the entire CR program is declared to be finished. </p>
