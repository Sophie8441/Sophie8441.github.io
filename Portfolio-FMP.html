                <h3>A systematic implementation to support personal fruit-intake behaviors in the home-based cardiac rehabilitation context.</h3>


                <p>This e-health project was a collaborative effort with Maxima Medisch Centrum in the Netherlands, aimed at addressing the issue of MMC's lack of a digital platform that could effectively track individual patient's food intake and goals. This led to frustration for patients and an increased burden on healthcare providers. Furthermore, the existing website was not user-friendly, particularly for senior patients who required accessible and effective feedback to make informed decisions. Our goal was to create scalable solutions that improved the overall user experience and promoted sustainable health behaviors in the telehealth domain.</p>
				  
				<p>Throughout the project, I engaged with multiple stakeholders, including industry experts and users, to gather feedback and co-create MVP. The process involved iterative research, design, and development phases, including agile development of IoT ecosystem solutions with the development team over three sprints. The resulting product was presented for its strategic potential to add value to the existing rehabilitation platform, demonstrating its design opportunity for real-world execution.</p>

				<h2><strong>How do the medical stakeholders perceive the existing platform in tracking patients’ (diet) goals? and How do they envision the future of telerehabilitation?</strong></h2>
				<h5>Discovering the problems of the industry client's existing platform and inquesting the future scenario</h5>
				<p>At the beginning of the project, to discover the problem more in-depth, it was very important for me to understand how healthcare providers perceived an existing platform for tracking patient diet goals. To get started, I conducted a card-sorting session to map out the assumptions.</p>
				<p>Through this process, I discovered that the medical stakeholders thought that the ease of use, particularly for the senior patient group was the most critical thing. Moreover, they thought that for them as healthcare providers receiving accurate information reduces their effects in tracking individual patients’ conditions. We wanted to ensure that the platform was not only functional but also intuitive enough to trigger sustainable behaviors among senior adults.</p>

				  <h2><strong>How does the user perceive the self-tracking methods on dietary behaviors in terms of easy-to-use and sustainable behaviors?</strong></h2>
			    <h5>Participatory design methods to engage target user groups</h5>
				 <p>I embarked on a design process for a health project that required behavior change. I knew that understanding the user's context was crucial, especially for the senior user groups, so I decided to prototype engaging user experiences and evaluate perceived values through diary study methods with user groups.</p>
				  <p>Through this process, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of what users expected and how we could make it more accessible for them to track their dietary behaviors. By tracking behavior change criteria and collecting feedback, I organized two main personas, one for those living alone and another for those living with partners.</p>	
				<p>These personas served as a guide for our design decisions, ensuring that we were addressing the unique needs of each user group. Through this approach, we were able to create solutions that not only met the functional requirements but also resonated with users and motivated behavior change.</p>

				<h2><strong>How might we use an engaging behavior-tracking approach to help the senior patient groups to achieve their goals in a more sustainable way?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>	
				<h5>Streamling the common values based on the feedback</h5>
					
				<p>I wanted to streamline feedback from medical stakeholders and users. To achieve this, I created some "<strong><span style="color:#73C08C">How Might We</span></strong>" statements, with the main one focusing on using an engaging behavior-tracking approach to help senior patients achieve their goals in a more sustainable way.</p>
				
				<p>Through co-reflecting sessions with stakeholders, we discussed user journeys, experiences, personas, and scenarios while ideating solutions and generating design assumptions. To ensure we were prioritizing the design assumptions that had a higher perceived value to end-users and a meaningful impact on stakeholders, we conducted a prioritization exercise.</p>
				
				<p>After prioritizing the design assumptions, we formulated a hypothesis: <strong><span style="color:#73C08C">"I believe that the combination of a tangible and digital user interface can engage senior patient groups' dietary behaviors as a daily routine, reducing their efforts in self-tracking and leading to sustainable impact."</span></strong></p>

			  <h2><strong>What do the design features mean to the end users and the industry clients?</strong></h2>
			<h5>Define design scope and value propositions</h5>
				<p>As the design scope was defined, I focused on communicating the specific values of the design features to stakeholders. To achieve this, I rapidly built a prototype and implemented the minimum viable product (MVP) during the first design sprint. I tested the interaction through an unmoderated usability test, followed by real-world user testing. To evaluate the user's behavior tracking information on the UI, I decided to use a mockup which was an efficient way to generate a better understanding of the information on the UI. </p>
				<p>Through this sprint, I was able to generate insights on concrete values about how a digital and tangible design could benefit the end-users and healthcare providers on different levels, such as user-engaging interactive feedback and behavio-tracking data collection.</p>

				<h2><strong>Design sprints on developing user-engaging features, and values added to behavior-tracking features.</strong></h2>
				 <h5>Agile Development for 3 design sprints</h5>
				  
				<p>After the propositions, I discussed with the industry client the features that wanted to include and improve. The focus, therefore, was to not only enhance the user experience but also create a more efficient and accurate data collection approach for healthcare providers.</p>
				
				<p>In agile development,  I worked closely with both software and electrical engineers to plan and create a product backlog. Prioritizing tasks based on importance and estimated effort, we then started developing the tangible device. During the second sprint, we focused on ensuring a smooth and stable user-system interaction. I collaborated with the development team daily to achieve this. After presenting the realized features to the industry client, we moved on to designing the behavior-tracking feature, which was integrated with an internet server for timely data access by healthcare providers.</p>
				  
				<p>Once the timeline was complete, I conducted user testing with senior groups to gain contextual insights about engaging behaviors. The feedback received was positive, but to ensure long-term sustainable impact, customized features could be added to the tangible device.

				<h2><strong>How to integrate the tangible device into the existing rehabilitation flow to help senior patients lower the threshold of entering telerehabilitation?</strong></h2>  
				<h5>Evaluation on UX system in telerehabilitation context</h5>
 				<p>After finalizing the features of the tangible device, I discussed with the business industry client to discuss how we could integrate the device into the existing rehabilitation flow to help senior patients enter telerehabilitation more easily.</p>
				<p>To accomplish this, I utilized user journey maps and process mapping to visualize the touchpoints between patients and healthcare providers. Based on these touchpoints, we generated design assumptions that were programmed into usability testing to explore how senior adults feel about being guided through the digital journey, planned behavior making, feedback receiving, and making sense of the tangible and digital UI.</p>
				<p>The insights we gathered from usability testing were then used to refine our design assumptions and create a user-centered design that met the needs of both patients and healthcare providers. The final result was a seamless integration of the tangible device into the existing rehabilitation flow, which helped lower the threshold for senior patients to enter telerehabilitation. </p>

			<h5>Usability testing on the criteria</h5>
			<p>For the usability testing on UI, I invited five participants who had previously engaged in the home-deployment iteration to continue evaluating their experiences using the digital UI. The aim of the study was to assess how users recognized the connection between user data visualization and digital guidance through the telerehabilitation journey. Specifically, we wanted to understand how accessible, useful, and informative the provided challenges were for the senior users. </p>
			<p>
			The study included five challenges, each of which was evaluated based on feasibility, accessibility, effectiveness of the system design, and user satisfaction. By gathering insights from the study, we were able to identify areas where the digital UI could be improved to better support users in their telerehabilitation journey. Ultimately, our goal was to create a more seamless and user-centered experience that would improve the effectiveness of the telerehabilitation system.</p>

				<h2>Learning & Takeaway</h2>
				<p>This Master Thesis Project was built upon <span style=" color:#34B8AF">the current architecture of the telerehabilitation system structured by Maxima MC, integrating the touchpoints with the healthcare providers from a patient-centered perspective.</span> The final results of the project were presented to the client and stakeholders for the potential of real-world executions. This project allowed me to acquire valuable learnings:</p>

              <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
				  
				  
				<h5>Project management skills to work with involved stakeholders. </h5>
				<p>Because the project involved many stakeholders (clients, domain experts, and users), I learned the importance of <span style=" color:#34B8AF">advance planning and efficient communication with different parties for scheduling sessions and time management skills.</span> In this project, I created a roadmap to file all the decision-making points and the time spent.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h5>Design communication is important when presenting the design concept to stakeholders.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </h5>
				<p>Furthermore, to be more flexible during the iterative process of working with stakeholders, <span style=" color:#34B8AF">making planning and sharing (discussion) results properly is critical in communication and project management. Preparing alternatives (plan B) to adapt/pivot to different situations.</span> Whereas, it is always important for a designer you could advocate why the design decision is better than other choices.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				  			  

				<h5>MVPs are the balance of the user's needs and technical constraints within the limited timeframe. </h5>
				<p>I spent weeks with developers in the organization to experiment/test the stability and the effectiveness of the prototype, from which I learned the importance of <span style=" color:#34B8AF">identified efficient MVPs to process the iterative development is built open prioritizing user requirements and balancing out the design increments with various technical constraints</span> within a limited time frame.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			  </div>
              <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">

				<h5>Creative Design thinking methods require user/stakeholders' engagement during the iterative process. </h5>
				<p>The methods of <span style=" color:#34B8AF">workshops and post-co-reflecting sessions to criticize the design from different perspectives</span> can bring the design concept to a more grounded and realistic level for execution not only building the confidence of the teammates but the stakeholders</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h5>Challenge when designing for the systematic approach (combined with tangible and digital UI) in complex scenarios: </h5>
				<p>The combined tangible and digital approach were proven effective and had strong potential for the target patient groups, where different levels of interaction were involved to motivate the user groups to follow the target diet goals. However, despite the entire telerehabilitation structure within the design concept being discussed with different domain experts, one of the challenges that should be further evaluated with user groups is <span style=" color:#34B8AF">the longer-term scenario when several telerehabilitation domains are simultaneously executed so that the way to interact and the information to be presented can be investigated and prioritized to avoid the overwhelming information. 
				As a service, prioritizing the functionalities with more impact or less effort on the experience could add value on a personalized level.</span></p>
