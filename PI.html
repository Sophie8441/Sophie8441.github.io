	    <h2><strong>My Background</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
		<p>     
			My name is Tzu-Jou, a second-year master student in the Industrial Design faculty of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e).
			Before coming to TU/e, I earned a bachelor's degree in industrial design in Taiwan. Previously, in terms of the aesthetic form of design, I enjoy doing some crafting, such as woodcraft modeling and ceramic crafting, both outside and inside the university. All of these practices, I believe, can shape my senses in creating design with an aesthetic. Aesthetics is also something that I believe is important for people in today's society to help shape and display their identity.
		</p>
			<p>On the other hand, since my bachelor period, I've been interested in how design can improve people's lives. I was also involved in a number of projects relating to the aging population, healthcare, and disabled groups. Throughout those projects, I realized that a design can truly bridge the gap between different user groups' needs, assisting people in learning and exploring themselves by serving as an effective communication tool. In my bachelor period, I spent one year in Barcelona, Spain, studying and doing an internship. This experience further allows me to learn how creativity and aesthetics can be integrated into people's lifestyles and contexts. Among these, a food design course inspired me the most, in which I explored the relationship between food and person using a tangible design approach.</p>
			
			<p>Additionally, I enjoy exploring/defining problems. I am sensitive to the details of life. In that sense, I am able to be inspired by everyday activities. I am convinced that sometimes the problem is more important than the solutions.  A quote from Henry Ford: “<em>If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.</em>” Customers/clients can describe what kind of solutions they want, while a designer can help redefine the real problems behind it and further reconstruct those recognized critical elements. In addition, I have learned that asking the right question is essential.</p>
			
			<p>Thinking about design applications, I realize that there are many relevant applications that use various kinds of design methodology to explore/define the critical relevant components with the stakeholders, And further by incorporating technical knowledge, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and even Artificial Intelligence (AI). This can together help to create a more sustainable experience by exploring Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Concerning my background and characteristics, the two main expertise areas that I would like to further develop as an industrial designer's unique profile are User & Society (U&S) and Creativity & Aesthetics (C&A). At the same time, I would also love to explore how the emerging technology (Technology & Realization) and the rich data (Math, Data, and Computing) can assist the design for more sustainable and innovative purposes.</p>

			<h2><strong>Exploring the development in expertise areas</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
			<p>Therefore, throughout my Master program, several elective courses that I selected focused on U&amp;S such as&nbsp; <a href="Portfolio-UXUI design.html"><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255 );">User Experience Theory &amp; Practices</a></span></strong> and 
		
			<a href="Portfolio-BehaviorChange.html"><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255 );">Design for Behavior Change</a></span></strong>. The courses focused on C&A include 
		
			<a href="Portfolio-InteractiveMateriality.html"><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255 );">Interactive Materiality</a></span></strong>, and <strong>The sound of smart things</strong>. The courses that focused on T&amp;R are <strong>Design UI with Emerging Technology</strong>, and <strong>Data-enabled Design </strong>(also the one that emphasizes data-supported research and development). At the same time, choosing projects that can make use of this knowledge can also help me gain experience in practice. Therefore, the theme of the projects that I chose throughout the Master program also has a strong focus on the domain of U&amp;S and C&amp;A. In practicality, other domains can act as a support for the findings and arguments of the outcomes.</p>
			

			
			

			
			  <p>For example, my first project 
			  
			  
			<a href="Portfolio-Coasterchat.html"><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255 );">"Coasterchat"</a></span></strong>	  
			focused on how a physical design can facilitate the connectedness between persons with dementia and their family members . My first individual research project explored how sound design can facilitate remote workers' break-to-work transition in the context of home working. In the second year, as an understanding from the user's point of view, I explored/observed a 2-week diary study for understanding how people with (different levels of) motivations in changing their dietary behaviors can benefit from the approaches that enable them to self-monitor and self-reflect in overall diet practices 
			<a href="Portfolio-ContextEnquiry.html"><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255 );">Link</a></span></strong>. For my final master project, I then generated relevant concepts according to the findings from the previous dietary study. I, therefore, managed to build a physical implementation for communicating (C&A) with the user. And using a 3-days user study to investigate how participants can exact experience the design (U&S). A technical deployment also requires knowledge of T&R.</p>
			
			<h2><strong>Future steps as a designer with an unique profile</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

			<p>For my strengths,  I think I’m open-minded and willing to try new things, and comfortable taking advice from others. Besides, I wouldn't mind taking criticism. I feel grateful for those who would take the time to check my projects and share their advice. Because it's always important in an evolving process and this can often produce positives in the end.  As for my weakness, I used to be quite a shy girl. Taking initiative during a conversation was never what I was good at.  But once realizing this can limit me from sharing and communicating ideas, I tried very hard to improve it. For instance, I might spend time learning the knowledge from the relevant topic so that I could have more knowledge base to express myself and discuss with others with different backgrounds. </p>
				
			<p>For the future development of my career (for example, working in a company), I would like to apply the knowledge that I learn and practice throughout my master's program. For instance, user study can help with the connections and empathy between all the stakeholders.  My expertise area in C&A can help to communicate my idea to others in a more effective and pleasant way.  Whereas, fro the equipment of other expertise areas could enable me to take more perspectives in developing an idea, and meanwhile, able to collaborate with other experts.</p>
